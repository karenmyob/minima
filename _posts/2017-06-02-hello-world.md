##### Who am I?
I am Karen Xie, a graduate developer fresh out of university. I love coding because I love to create. I love that these creations can make our lives more easy and convenient. I love that coding is a never-ending journey of learning.

I actually did a year of Biomedical Science before I decided to switch to Engineering. The plan was to become an optometrist, but because my physics and chemistry were not as great as my biology, I failed. This is one of many failures in my life which I can wholeheartedly say I am glad about! Failing to get into Optometry allowed me to find my passion for coding.

##### Why am I writing this blog?
A certain team lead of mine gave me the idea of starting a blog post to share my experiences as a developer. To be honest, I'm not much of a writer but I like to give things a go before shooting them down. Plus, it might be a good way to get my thoughts together for this crazy journey I've been having. I want to structure the jumble of notes I've taken at work and document what it's like to start as a newbie developer in this big industry. I want this blog to be very personal, showing both my failures and successes so far. Hopefully this will be helpful to those who are also just starting out. :)
